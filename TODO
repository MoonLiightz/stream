Stream:
    ☐ Setup Chatty (https://chatty.github.io/) @created(20-02-15 11:48)
        Chatty does not provide a package with a bundle JRE/JDK
            * Either search for another tool thats like Chatty
            * JRE/JDK as portable version to execute just Chatty
    ☐ Have a look at (potentially) existing logs regarding the crashes of OBS @created(20-02-17 21:30)
        Found something in the system log which points to browser sources.
        I really think this could be the problem but we had not freeze or crash in the stream of 2020-02-21 while not using the tv as an additional monitor
