### Learning Go #2

I finally made it through the [Go tour](https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1) which I started in the last stream.

Even though I was extremely tired because of not much sleep this night.

## Unexpected/Problematic things

Fortunately nothing :thumbsup:

## Lessons learned

We learned a lot about Go again :smile:

One thing I want to point out is that Go has no exceptions. That's not really a thing I've expected because all languages I know do have them. **I like it tbh.**

> I just took a look at Rust and it also does not have exception.

## Other stuff

We discussed a little bit about Java (again) and if exceptions overall are a good or a bad thing.
