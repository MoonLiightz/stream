### Enhancing Twirgo

## Unexpected/Problematic things

I thought it would be nice if the library would not only provide a channel with all events but also callbacks and a way to directly define commands.

Both features were developed in the stream but in two commits. The [first commit](https://github.com/curi0s/twirgo/commit/264f32367a4be9c058be2d3e11366ce02c99c64d) provides callbacks and the [second commit](https://github.com/curi0s/twirgo/commit/ece20fe740ebff0f0cba009ff175bdb78e68431d) provides additionally the commands feature.

I also added two examples for both featues

* [callbacks](https://github.com/curi0s/twirgo/blob/master/examples/using_callbacks.go)
* [commands](https://github.com/curi0s/twirgo/blob/master/examples/using_commands.go)

> The URLs will change in the near future. I hope I don't forget about these links and will change them.

There are still things I have to do.

1. The documentation of public methods, types and so on.
2. Moving the examples to it's own directories

## Other stuff

### New OS

I switched my OS from Mac OS to Arch Linux. It was the first tech stream using Linux and it worked quite well.

#### Why did I switch

I had several freezes with Mac OS mostly while using Cisco WebEx (for work) and it was not only annoying but also problematic because of the business talks that were interrupted. And as mentioned in the [first recap](stream%20recaps/2020-02-15/README.md), the freezes also happened during the tech streams.
