### Learning Go #1

I started to learn [Go](https://www.golang.org) with the [Go tour](https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1), a tutorial series provided by the website of Go.
It's really good structured and I could easily understand the slides I read so far. I stopped at [Map literals](https://tour.golang.org/moretypes/20) because it was already after 10pm UTC+1 and I was really tired.
We discussed a lot about the syntax of Go and I asked a lot of questions, simply to fully understand the slides we had until this point.

And at this point a very special thanks to [CodeCereal aka @muesli](https://github.com/muesli) for answering **all** of my questions.

If you are interested in everything I did related to Go, I created a [Git repo](https://github.com/curi0s/learning-go).

## Unexpected/Problematic things

Nothing, yippi :smile:

## Lessons learned

It's simple, a lot about Go so far :smile:

## Other stuff

A streamtopic for a future stream could be a discussion about Linux distributions. We were close to start this discussion in this stream already.
