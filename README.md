# Stream repository

I've decided to document anything regarding [the stream](#the-stream) in english. On the one hand to improve my english skills overall and on the other hand to allow non german speaking people to unterstand what am I doing on stream and on this repository. [The stream](#the-stream) will for the time being not be in englisch (sorry mates).

Feel free to "pull request" changes if for typos, my bad english skills, ideas (**PLEASE DO THAT üòÅ**) or other things like suggestions for the stream or this repo.

## "The stream"

I think I have to define what "the stream" means. Over the past 4 1/2 years I've mostly been streaming Rocket League (and will continue to stream it in the future too) **but** this repository and the [todos](#todos) will only for tech like streams, not for gaming streams.

Most of the streams will be made with my [hackintosh](#hackintosh)
