# Stream repository

I've decided to document anything regarding [the stream](#the-stream) in english. Firstly to improve my english skills overall and secondly to allow non german speaking people to unterstand what am I doing on stream and on this repository. [The stream](#the-stream) will for the time being not be in english (sorry guys).

Feel free to "pull request" changes if for typos, my bad english skills, ideas (**PLEASE DO THAT :smiley:**) or other things like suggestions for the stream or this repo. Feel free to add yourself to the [contributors list](#heart-contributors).

## "The stream"

I think I have to define what "the stream" means. Over the past 4 1/2 years I've mostly been streaming Rocket League (and will continue to stream it in the future too) **but** this repository and the [todos](#todos) will only be for tech like streams, not for gaming streams.

Most of the streams will be made with my [hackintosh](#computer-hackintosh)

## Todos

There is a [TODO file](TODO) in this repository that _should_ contain all todos for this repo and the streams

## :movie_camera: Stream recaps

As an additional "feature" of this repository and the streams I will (hopefully) write a recap for every stream. You should find them all in the folder [stream recaps](stream%20recaps/) named by the date (format: YYYY-MM-DD) the streams were done.

I _try_ to cover the following list of topics in each recap.

1. What were the topics of the stream? (Short: Topics)
2. Unexpected or problematic things that happend during the stream (Short: Unexpected/Problematic things)
3. What did I/we learn? (Short: Lessons learned)
4. Things that are not covered by the other topics (Short: Other stuff)

## :construction: Projects

They are seperated in different categories. Each category has it's description why projects are listed there.

> Projects will be separately documented in the [Projects](projects/) directory.

### Potential

- Build a new Discord bot
- curiMans
  - A six mans like bot specifically for my Discord server
- Twitch plays Rocket League (1v1)
  - Every viewer who wants to control a car has to choose a team, either blue or orange. After doing this, commands like !back, !fw (forward), !fleft (forward left), ... are available and the car will execute the commands (should be queued)
- Evaluate ways to run bots e.g. Discord or Twitch in a high available setup
  - The problem is that you can not simply start the bot multiple times/multiple instances because on every command a user executes, each bot would react to this and for example responds with a message to the user

### In progress

Projects will be in this category if we started to work on them (again).

### Done

Projects are done if the initial planned features are implemented. A project may or may not move to [in progress](#in-progress) if bigger changes (more than a couple todos) have to be made.

- Build a new Twitch bot especially for the tech streams ([Repository](https://github.com/curi0s/twitch-bot))

### Denied

Projects in this category have been denied due to different reasons.

Nothing here so far ðŸ¤—
