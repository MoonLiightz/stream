# Stream repository

I've decided to document anything regarding [the stream](#the-stream) in english. Firstly to improve my english skills overall and secondly to allow non german speaking people to unterstand what am I doing on stream and in this repository. [The stream](#the-stream) will for the time being not be in english (sorry guys).

Feel free to "pull request" changes, if for typos, my bad english skills, ideas (**PLEASE DO THAT :smiley:**) or other things like suggestions for the stream or this repo. Feel free to add yourself to the [contributors list](#heart-contributors).

## "The stream"

I think I have to define what "the stream" means. Over the past 4 1/2 years I've mostly been streaming Rocket League (and will continue to stream it in the future too) **but** this repository and the [todos](#todos) will only be for tech like streams, not for gaming streams.

Most of the streams will be made with my [hackintosh](#computer-hackintosh)

## Todos

There is a [TODO file](TODO) in this repository that _should_ contain all todos for this repo and the streams.

The extension I use for this Todo list is [Todo+](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=fabiospampinato.vscode-todo-plus)

## :movie_camera: Stream recaps

As an additional "feature" of this repository and the streams, I will (hopefully) write a recap for every stream. You should find them all in the folder [stream recaps](stream%20recaps/) named by the date (format: YYYY-MM-DD) the streams were done.

I _try_ to cover the following list of topics in each recap.

1. What were the topics of the stream? (Short: Topics)
2. Unexpected or problematic things that happend during the stream (Short: Unexpected/Problematic things)
3. What did I/we learn? (Short: Lessons learned)
4. Things that are not covered by the other topics (Short: Other stuff)

### Direct links

- [Stream #001 (2020-02-15) - Twitch bot](stream%20recaps/2020-02-15/README.md)
- [Stream #002 (2020-02-21) - Running bots in a high availability setup](stream%20recaps/2020-02-21/README.md)
- Stream #003 (2020-02-24) - Learning Go #1\
  Will be a short one

## :construction: Projects

They are seperated in different categories. Each category has it's description why projects are listed there.

Projects will be separately documented in the [Projects](projects/) directory if they are not already covert by any [stream recap](#movie_camera-stream-recaps).

### Potential

- Discord related
  - **Build a new Discord bot** (curi0sDE_BOT)
  - **curiMans**\
    A six mans like bot specifically for my Discord server
- Twitch related
  - **Twitch plays Rocket League (1v1)**\
    Every viewer who wants to control a car has to choose a team, either blue or orange. After doing this, commands like !back, !fw (forward), !fleft (forward left), ... are available and the car will execute the commands (should be queued)

### In progress

Projects will be in this category if we started to work on them (again). This could be the case if either we couldn't finish it in one stream, add new features or want to make bigger changes to it.

- **Learning Go** (God damn [@muesli](https://github.com/muesli) :unamused:)

### Done

Projects are done if the initial planned features are implemented. A project may or may not move to [in progress](#in-progress) if bigger changes (more than a couple todos) have to be made.

- **Build a new Twitch bot especially for the tech streams** ([Repository](https://github.com/curi0s/twitch-bot))
- **Evaluate ways to run bots e.g. Discord or Twitch in a high availability setup**\
  The problem is that you can not simply start the bot multiple times/multiple instances because on every command a user executes, each bot would react to this and for example responds with a message to the user

### Denied

Projects in this category have been denied due to different reasons.

Nothing here so far ðŸ¤—

## Bot commands

These are some informations the bot would usually provide in the chat.
